# The Dactyl-ManuForm Keyboard - Python 3 - Cadquery
This is a fork of [Dactyl-Manuform](https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard) by Tom Short, which itself is a fork of [Dactyl](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard) by Matthew Adereth, a parameterized, split-hand, concave, columnar, ergonomic keyboard.

While the code structure remains comparable to the original, Clojure and OpenSCAD have been replaced by Python and cadquery/OpenCASCADE.  The predecessors were exceptional contributions to the ergo keyboard community. My hope is that by converting the code the community will have an easier time modifying and evolving this design.  

## Added Feature
Added a new switch for hot swap and a way to include any additional geometry in the key plate by use of an imported file.  For hot swap just change the line to `hot_swap = True`.  To import an arbitrary geometry set the `plate_file = None` and `plate_offset = 0.0`.  The file must be .step for OpenCascade / cadquery and .stl for openSCAD / solid python.  The zero reference should be the key center (XY), and the top of the plate (Z).  Plate offset is a Z-axis translation for minor adjustments without modifying the geometry file.  If you don't want the "nubs" you have to modify the plate function.  It will propagate to all key plate usage.  

**DISCLAIMER:  I have not built the hot swap version and cannot speak to the geometry.  I found it running around in various places and don't know the origin.**  

If you know the origin I would like to credit the originator.  If you test it I'd love to know how well it works or if you come up with a better geometry I'm happy to add it.

The main change is that the thumb cluster was adapted from the [ManuForm keyboard](https://github.com/jeffgran/ManuForm) ([geekhack](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=46015.0)). The walls were changed to just drop to the floor. The keyboard is parameterized to allow adjusting the following: 

* Rows: 4 - 6 
* Columns: 5 and up
* Row curvature
* Column curvature
* Row tilt (tenting)
* Column tilt
* Column offsets
* Height

I built a 4x5 version (40% size) for myself. The default has a bit more tenting than the Dactyl. See the following model files for configurations that may be most common:

* [40% size, (4x5)](https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard/blob/master/things/right-4x5.stl)
* [60% size, (5x6)](https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard/blob/master/things/right-5x6.stl)
